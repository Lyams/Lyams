### Hi everybody 👋

I'm a Ruby developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ["Building your own authentication library with Trailblazer"](https://leanpub.com/buildalib) because I was offered to use it in a test task for a Junior Ruby Developer.

- 🔭 And this is me on codewars: [Lyams](https://www.codewars.com/users/Lyams)
