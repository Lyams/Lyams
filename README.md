### Hi everybody 👋

I'm a Ruby on rails software engineer.

- 🔭 And this is me on codewars: [Lyams](https://www.codewars.com/users/Lyams) <img src="public/codewars.png" alt="Codewars Profile of Lyams" width="25%" align="right"/>
- [My new blog](https://lyams.github.io/Over-a-cup-of-hot-drink-with-Ilia/posts/) (on Russian; in development)

<!--
**Lyams/Lyams** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ["Building your own authentication library with Trailblazer"](https://leanpub.com/buildalib) because I was offered to use Trailblazer in a test task for a Ruby Developer.
